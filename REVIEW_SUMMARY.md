## 🚨 Top 3 Critical Issues

### 1. Session Encryption Disabled ⚠️
**File:** `.env`  
**Current:** `SESSION_ENCRYPT=false`  
**Fix:** `SESSION_ENCRYPT=true`  
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Impact:** Protects user sessions from tampering

### 2. Missing CSRF Tokens in Fetch Calls ⚠️
**File:** `resources/js/hooks/use-two-factor-auth.ts`  
**Issue:** No CSRF token in fetch requests  
**Fix:** Add CSRF token from meta tag  
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Prevents CSRF attacks

### 3. No Security Headers ⚠️
**Issue:** Missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)  
**Fix:** Add security headers middleware  
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Impact:** Protects against clickjacking, XSS, etc.

**Total time to fix all 3: ~50 minutes**

## 🎯 Quick Wins (Easy + High Impact)

These improvements take minimal time but provide significant benefits:

1. ✅ **Enable session encryption** - 1 line in .env (5 min)
2. ✅ **Add React.memo to AlertError** - Wrap component (5 min)
3. ✅ **Extract magic numbers to constants** - Better readability (10 min)
4. ✅ **Fix duplicate useEffect fetch** - Remove redundant call (5 min)
5. ✅ **Add ARIA labels** - Better accessibility (10 min)

**Total: 35 minutes for 5 improvements**
